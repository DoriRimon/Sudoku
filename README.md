# Sudoku
This is the well known Sudoku game.</br>
At any point in the game, you can press the 'solve' button, starting a backtracking algorithm that will solve the board

## Backtracking
Generally the code for solving the sudoku works with backtracking.

## Efficiency
Simple, though efficient (Writing the algorithms for the methods of the game was a question in 
an exam I had, where all the game methods need to be implemented in O(1), and the DS needs to be
initialized in O(n^2)).

Note: obviously the solving method isn't efficient, I just wanted to experiment with backtracking.. </br>
I might add a more elegant solution in the future.

The [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) channel gave me the idea to make this project (Though I implemented everything myself).
